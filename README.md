Solves for the flow-field generated by a point force (stokeslet) bounded by a cylinder [a la Liron & Shahar](http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0022112078001366).  The notation and equations are described in equations (4.4)--(4.19) and the appendix of that paper.  The solution is given numerically in terms of infinite summations and unbounded integrals with modified Bessel functions acting as kernels.

Since the computation time (~ 2 seconds) is too slow to be generated at run-time when incorporated with the elastic flagella model, it is generated a priori and stored, then loaded into an elastic solver (Dynamic Elastic Rods).
